Pipeline for performing an eQTL analysis on single cell + genotype data, with 
the option to perform summary-data-based mendelian randomization using SMR


Install and activate conda environment from env.yml
Note: if using MacOS, remove plink2 from the env.yml file and install otherwise

Download + unpack SMR and OSCA for your OS from 
https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/smr/#Overview, add to PATH 

cd into eqtl_pipeline directory, pipeline must be run from inside the dir


Usage:

./bash_eqtl.sh PLINK_OBJECT SCRNA_OBJECT CLUSTER_NAME COVARIATES WORKDIR [GWAS_SUM_STATS] [NUM_CPUS]

PLINK_OBJECT: Path to PLINK genotype object (omitting any file extension)
SCRNA_OBJECT: Path to h5ad object with gene expression data (QCed ideally)
CLUSTER_NAME: Name of the column in obs of SCRNA_OBJECT to use as cluster labels, used as covariates downstream
COVARIATES: Path to CSV containing covariates. Should contain at minimum "Sample", "Age", "Sex" columns
WORKDIR: Path to directory to save all files to
[GWAS_SUM_STATS]: Optional. Path to GWAS Summary statistics file (in COJO format) to analyze with eQTL data using SMR
[NUM_CPUS]: Optional. Number of CPUs to use. Default 1

Notes:
    - All paths can be gcloud paths or local paths. If GCloud paths are passed,
      files will be copied to the WORKDIR before proceeding
    - Make sure Sample names align between PLINK_OBJECT, SCRNA_OBJECT, and 
      COVARIATES files. Nothing will work if they do not
    - If running SMR, note that GWAS summary statistics file MUST be in 
      GCTA-COJO format (although n column can be NA as it is not access in SMR).
      Use finngen_to_COJO.sh for converting Finngen data, or see SMR docs for
      file format
